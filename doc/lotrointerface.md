This plugin creates a single window that contains all the available travel skills, including the race, class and reputation skills. It is a further development of Travel Window, that has been worked on by multiple authors before.

[B]Since this plugin is a replacement for Travel Window you should not have both enabled at the same time. You can keep them both installed though.[/B]

Installation:
This is a full plugin and can be installed standalone. Follow the general plugin installation instructions to install Travel Window II or update the install (depends on your OS).
I recommend you install and manage your plugins with the LOTRO Plugin Compendium found here, since it will install plugins cleanly and take care of installing the Turbine utilities for you: [URL="http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html"]http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html[/URL]

If you do not use Plugin Compendium, you need to manually install Turbine utilities that are available at:
[URL="http://content.turbine.com/sites/lotro/lua/Beta_LuaPlugins.7z"]http://content.turbine.com/sites/lotro/lua/Beta_LuaPlugins.7z[/URL]
This has to be extracted to your "Documents\The Lord of the Rings Online\Plugins" folder (if you are on Windows) so two folders called Turbine and TurbinePlugins show up there.
